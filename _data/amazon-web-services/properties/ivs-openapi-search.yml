        <p>Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to
        Amazon S3.</p> <p> <b>Known issue:</b> In the us-east-1 region, if you
        use the Amazon Web Services CLI to create a recording configuration, it
        returns success even if the S3 bucket is in a different region. In this
        case, the <code>state</code> of the recording configuration is
        <code>CREATE_FAILED</code> (instead of <code>ACTIVE</code>). (In other
        regions, the CLI correctly returns failure if the bucket is in a
        different region.)</p> <p> <b>Workaround:</b> Ensure that your S3 bucket
        is in the same region as the recording configuration. If you create a
        recording configuration in a different region as your S3 bucket, delete
        that recording configuration and create a new one with an S3 bucket from
        the correct region.</p>

        If you subsequently use CreateStreamKey on the same channel, it will
        fail because a stream key already exists and there is a limit of 1
