        <p>Adds the source of resource-maps to the draft version of an
        application. During assessment, Resilience Hub will use these
        resource-maps to resolve the latest physical ID for each resource in the

        resources suported by Resilience Hub and how to add them in your

        <p>Creates an Resilience Hub application. An Resilience Hub application
        is a collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to prevent
        and recover Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To describe a
        Resilience Hub application, you provide an application name, resources
        from one or more CloudFormation stacks, Resource Groups, Terraform state
        files, AppRegistry applications, and an appropriate resiliency policy.
        In addition, you can also add resources that are located on Amazon
        Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters as optional resources.
        For more information about the number of resources supported per
        application, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/resiliencehub.html#limits_resiliencehub">Service
        quotas</a>.</p> <p>After you create an Resilience Hub application, you
        publish it so that you can run a resiliency assessment on it. You can
        then use recommendations from the assessment to improve resiliency by
        running another assessment, comparing results, and then iterating the
        process until you achieve your goals for recovery time objective (RTO)
        and recovery point objective (RPO).</p>

        <p>Updates a resiliency policy.</p> <note> <p>Resilience Hub allows you
        to provide a value of zero for <code>rtoInSecs</code> and
        <code>rpoInSecs</code> of your resiliency policy. But, while assessing
        your application, the lowest possible assessment result is near zero.
        Hence, if you provide value zero for <code>rtoInSecs</code> and
        <code>rpoInSecs</code>, the estimated workload RTO and estimated
        workload RPO result will be near zero and the <b>Compliance status</b>
        for your application will be set to <b>Policy breached</b>.</
