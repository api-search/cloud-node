      summary: 'Assume Decorated Role With SAML '
      description: >-
        <p>Allows a caller to assume an IAM role decorated as the SAML user
        specified in the SAML assertion included in the request. This decoration
        allows Lake Formation to enforce access policies against the SAML users
        and groups. This API operation requires SAML federation setup in the
        callerâ€™s account as it can only be called with valid SAML assertions.
        Lake Formation does not scope down the permission of the assumed role.
        All permissions attached to the role via the SAML federation setup will
        be included in the role session. </p> <p> This decorated role is
        expected to access data in Amazon S3 by getting temporary access from
        Lake Formation which is authorized via the virtual API
        <code>GetDataAccess</code>. Therefore, all SAML roles that can be
        assumed via <code>AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML</code> must at a minimum
        include <code>lakeformation:GetDataAccess</code> in their role policies.
        A typical IAM policy attached to such a role would look as follows: </p>
