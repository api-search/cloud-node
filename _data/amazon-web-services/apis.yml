      Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a robust container
      management service provided by Amazon. It enables easy running, stopping,
      and management of Docker containers with high scalability and speed.
      Amazon ECS allows you to host your container clusters on a serverless
      infrastructure using Fargate or on Amazon EC2 instances that you manage.
      With Amazon ECS, you can effortlessly launch and stop container-based
      applications through simple API calls and benefit from centralized
      monitoring capabilities and familiar Amazon EC2 features. Additionally,
      Amazon ECS offers advanced scheduling capabilities for placing containers
      based on resource requirements, isolation policies, and availability
      needs. By using Amazon ECS, you can simplify cluster management,
      configuration, and scalability, eliminating the need for your own cluster
      and configuration management systems.

      and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all AWS Regions in the user's
      account to simplify cross-Region workloads. By turning on Resource
      Explorer, users can scan and index resources in each Region, with the
      option to designate one Region as the aggregator index for the account.
      This aggregator index contains a copy of all resource information from all
      Regions where Resource Explorer is enabled. Users can access a
      comprehensive view of their resources across all indexed Regions in their
      account. For more information on enabling and configuring Resource
      Explorer, refer to the user guide provided by Amazon Web Services.

      The Amazon WorkDocs API is tailored for a variety of use cases, including
      file migration, security applications, and eDiscovery/analytics. The API
      supports file migration applications for users looking to transfer files
      from different systems, while also allowing for basic metadata changes.
      Security applications can utilize the API actions to detect changes in
      WorkDocs and take necessary actions to ensure data security. General
      administrative applications, such as eDiscovery and analytics, can record
      and replicate data from WorkDocs for backup and analysis purposes.
